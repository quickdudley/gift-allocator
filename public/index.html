      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p id="intro">In order to simplify our Christmas festivities last year:
    my sister suggested that we could arrange things so each family member
    only gave and received one present each. At the time I wrote a command line
    program in Haskell to allocate each family member another one to give
    a present to. This page is essentially the same thing: but in the form of
    a web app in React.js</p>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>Type the name of each participant into the text box labelled
    &quot;Name&quot;. If any participant requires assistance
    (i.e. due to visual impairment): check the box labelled
    &quot;Assistance required&quot; and check the names of each person
    able to assist. When you've finished editing a participant's name and
    details: you can click add. Once everyone is entered: click
    &quot;Do allocations&quot;, download the generated text files, and
    send them to the recipients named.</p>
